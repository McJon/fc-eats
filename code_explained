in schema in settings we have

{
   "type": "checkbox",
   "id": "toggle",
   "label": "Toggle Message Bar",
   "default": false
},

and then we have if

{% if section.settings.toggle %}
<div class="message-bar">
//all code
</div>
{% endif %}

so that if in shopify we do have checkbox the content well be displayed,
if not not

2
I a dded this /pages/ because it did not work when trying to go to url
from homepage and not from [ages
]
{% if section.settings.homepage %}
  <a href="/pages/{{ section.settings.homepage }}">Go to the page</a>
{% endif %}

and this is what allows to choose the page to go to from shopify

    {
   "type": "page",
   "id": "homepage",
   "label": "Link to page"
},
